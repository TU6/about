# Team Unknown6 [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)]

From _**4th August 2016 - 00:49 GMT +1**_ until _**7th August 2016 - 01:05 GMT +1**_, amazing things happened.
A community of Pokémon GO players from all around the world came together with the intention of restoring service to the third-party PoGO API.

We were collectively dubbed **Team Unknown6**. The events which followed during those three and a half days was nothing short of special, and unforgettable.

It was a lengthy battle of teamwork and raw effort to decrypt the U6 generation algorithm. The collaboration begun via the PokémonGoDev sub-reddit. After hysteria from the community of third-party developers and users, it was clear a more efficient communication stream had to be opened; the Discord (live-chat) was founded. A miracle of seamless collaboration begun between highly experienced engineers, this lead to multiple wiki pages and Github repositories created to track and pool together progress.

Niantic shut off the original method of communicating with the Pokémon GO API in retaliation to botters abusing their privileges. However, the API had other major uses: such as building maps, inventory management, batch actions on Pokémon among a whole assortment of other very useful, non-distruptive tools.
To date, we cannot think of one major Pokémon GO community that wasn't built off the back of applications which made use of the API.

Niantic should look at why the community is resorting to such methods in the first place. "If Niantic won't provide what the community are demanding, the community will provide it for them."
Personally speaking, if a community had such a strong desire that they came together to work on a joint effort like this, we'd answer them head on.
It's not every day that you see a fanbase as passionate as this, to unify so quickly on one point and take action.

This is a testament to how much potential the game has, and personally, we feel Niantic Inc. is not making full use of this potential and are dragging their feet in the dirt because of it.
In short; Niantic, create an official, public API. Work with the community to build an application ecosystem. We all profit.
Otherwise, you're going to be left with not just a broken game, but with a broken community also.
